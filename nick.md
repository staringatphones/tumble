### When I get home from a long day I want to...

Work on a project of my own! If I’ve got something fun to work on. I’ve got this cool idea for a spoof dating app that I still want to try. If not, I like to just make some food, sit on the couch, and enjoy watching a show.

Europe! I want to go on a Mediterranean cruise and see France, Italy, and maybe Greece. Then I want to go inland and see Germany, Switzerland, and England too!


### In a relationship, I am looking for...

Right now, mostly just looking for an exclusive friend to go on dates with and snuggle with. After that, well, I hope it leads to a real relationship. I want to get married and have kids one day, and maybe that could be with you!
